## Global Optimization

As a global optimization platform, EAGO's solvers can be used to find solutions of general nonconvex problems with a guaranteed certificate of optimality. However, global solvers suffer from the curse of dimensionality and therefore their performance is  outstripped by convex solvers. For users interested in large-scale applications, be warned that problems generally larger than a few variables may prove challenging for certain types of global optimization problems.

## Package Capabilities

The EAGO package has numerous features: a solver accessible from JuMP/MathOptInterface, domain reduction routines, McCormick relaxations, and specialized non-convex semi-infinite program solvers. A full description of all EAGO features is available in the documentation website.

## Recent News

- 6/14/2019: [EAGO v0.2.0 has been tagged](https://github.com/PSORLab/EAGO.jl/releases/tag/v0.2.0). This update creates a number of breaking changes to the EAGO API. Please review the use cases provided in the documentation to update examples.
  - Updated to support Julia 1.0+, MathOptInterface (MOI), and MOI construction of subproblems.
  - Additional domain reduction routines available.
  - Support for specialized handling of linear and quadratic terms.
  - Significant performance improvements due to pre-allocation of Wengert tapes and MOI support.
  - A more intuitive API for McCormick relaxation construction.
- 7/5/2019: **EAGO v0.2.1 has been tagged**. This contains fixes for a few minor issues.
  - Bug fix for explicit SIP solving routine that occurred for uncertainty sets of dimension greater than 1.
  - Bug fix for Max objective sense.
