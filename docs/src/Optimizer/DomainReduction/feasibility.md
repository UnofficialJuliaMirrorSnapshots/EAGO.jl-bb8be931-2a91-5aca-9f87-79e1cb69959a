# Feasibility-Based Bound Tightening

## Duality-Based Bound Tightening
Bound tightening based on the duality multipliers are supported.

## Special Forms
Bound tightening for linear forms, univariate quadratic forms, and bivariate quadratic forms are also supported.

## Constraint Propagation
EAGO contains a constraint propagation architecture that supported forward and
reverse evaluation of set-valued functions on the directed acyclic graph (DAG).
The interval contractor and reverse McCormick relaxation-based contractors are
currently available.
