# User-Define Functions and DAG Utilities

EAGO has included basic functionality to manipulate user-defined functions.
These features are largely experimental and we're interested in providing
additional for novel use cases. Please contact us by opening an issue in
the Github [**issue tracker**](https://github.com/PSORLab/EAGO.jl/issues) with
any questions or requests for additional features.
