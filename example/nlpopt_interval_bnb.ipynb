    "### Overview  \n",
    "In this section, we construct an optimizer that uses EAGO's basic nlp solution routine with user-defined lower and upper bounding problems. The **EAGO.Optimizer** structure supplies a number of parameters and stored structures that advanced users may find useful for constructing specialized solution routines. For a full review, of the EAGO.optimizer object the reader is directed to the **EAGO.Optimizer** docstring and documentation provided at [https://psorlab.github.io/EAGO.jl/stable/](https://psorlab.github.io/EAGO.jl/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll forgo extensive integration into the EAGO.optimizer and simply replace the lower and upper-bounding problems to construct B&B routine that solves the following problem to global optimality using bounds obtained from interval arithmetic:\n",
